                    <p>Hello, I'm Amber.</p><br>
                    <p>A 21 year old game-development student from Haaksbergen. I graduated MBO 4 game-development at the ROC van Twente and am currently studying Create Media and Game Technologies at Saxion - University of Applied Science. </p><br>
                    <p>I have mainly developed games using C# and Unity. I also have great experience with Java and got experience with Javascript by working at Osasense. </p><br>
                    <p>Python, F#, HTML and CSS are languages I have dabbled around in and thus have less experience with.</p>

                <h1>My Experience</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>I have been programming for a little over 8 years. It started with Minecraft mods in Java, and little Java games. <br> 
                    Soon after I started a study in game-development at ROC van Twente. After that most my time went to working with C# and Unity3D and a little with Unreal Engine 4. <br>
                    I have made a lot of cool projects over the years that I feel like have given me a broad view of what the Unity engine is capable of.<br>
                    For example, I have worked on simple 2D platformers, but also intricate 2D platformers with multiplayer support.<br>
                    In the 3D section I have worked on simple puzzle games, endless runners, but also full recreations of bigger games or their mechanics,<br>
                    like Attack on Titan 2 or Fatal Frame.
